# Implementation Plan: [FEATURE]

**Branch**: `[###-feature-name]` | **Date**: [DATE] | **Spec**: [link]
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/[###-feature-name]/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/sp.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

[Extract from feature spec: primary requirement + technical approach from research]

## Technical Context

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: Replace the content in this section with the technical details
  for the project. The structure here is presented in advisory capacity to guide
  the iteration process.
-->

**Language/Version**: [e.g., Python 3.11, Swift 5.9, Rust 1.75 or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Primary Dependencies**: [e.g., FastAPI, UIKit, LLVM or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Storage**: [if applicable, e.g., PostgreSQL, CoreData, files or N/A]  
**Testing**: [e.g., pytest, XCTest, cargo test or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Target Platform**: [e.g., Linux server, iOS 15+, WASM or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]
**Project Type**: [single/web/mobile - determines source structure]  
**Performance Goals**: [domain-specific, e.g., 1000 req/s, 10k lines/sec, 60 fps or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Constraints**: [domain-specific, e.g., <200ms p95, <100MB memory, offline-capable or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Scale/Scope**: [domain-specific, e.g., 10k users, 1M LOC, 50 screens or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

### Security by Default Compliance
- [ ] All API endpoints will require a valid JWT
- [ ] User data isolation will be enforced at every layer
- [ ] No unauthenticated or cross-user access will be allowed

### Spec-Driven Development Compliance
- [ ] Every feature will be explicitly derived from a written spec
- [ ] All API behavior will be deterministic and documented
- [ ] Will follow the spec → plan → tasks → implementation workflow

### Zero Manual Coding Compliance
- [ ] All code will be generated via Qwen Code
- [ ] No manual coding will be performed
- [ ] Clear separation of concerns (auth, backend, frontend) will be maintained
- [ ] Outputs will be deterministic and reviewable at every phase

### Technology Standardization Compliance
- [ ] Frontend will use Next.js 16+ with App Router
- [ ] Backend will use FastAPI (Python)
- [ ] ORM will use SQLModel
- [ ] Database will use Neon Serverless PostgreSQL
- [ ] Authentication will use Better Auth (JWT-based)

### Security Enforcement Compliance
- [ ] Authentication will be stateless and cryptographically verifiable
- [ ] JWTs will be verified using a shared secret (BETTER_AUTH_SECRET)
- [ ] User identity will be derived from JWT claims only
- [ ] URL user_id will match authenticated user identity
- [ ] Invalid, missing, or expired tokens will return 401 Unauthorized
- [ ] No hardcoded secrets or credentials will be in source code

### API Design Standards Compliance
- [ ] RESTful endpoint design will be followed
- [ ] Proper HTTP status codes will be used for all operations
- [ ] Task ownership will be enforced on every query
- [ ] No cross-user reads or writes will be allowed under any condition
- [ ] Backend will be stateless and session-free

## Complexity Tracking

> **Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified**

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| [e.g., 4th project] | [current need] | [why 3 projects insufficient] |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |
