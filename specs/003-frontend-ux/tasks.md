# Tasks: Frontend Application & UX

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/003-frontend-ux/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), spec.md (required for user stories), research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

**Tests**: The examples below include test tasks. Tests are OPTIONAL - only include them if explicitly requested in the feature specification.

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`

- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions

- **Single project**: `src/`, `tests/` at repository root
- **Web app**: `backend/src/`, `frontend/src/`
- **Mobile**: `api/src/`, `ios/src/` or `android/src/`
- Paths shown below assume web app structure - adjust based on plan.md structure

## Phase 1: Setup (Shared Infrastructure)

**Purpose**: Project initialization and basic structure

- [X] T001 Create frontend project structure per implementation plan in frontend/
- [X] T002 [P] Initialize Next.js 16+ project with TypeScript in frontend/
- [X] T003 [P] Install required dependencies (Better Auth, Tailwind CSS, SWR) in frontend/
- [X] T004 Set up basic directory structure (app/, components/, services/, hooks/, etc.) in frontend/src/

---

## Phase 2: Foundational (Blocking Prerequisites)

**Purpose**: Core infrastructure that MUST be complete before ANY user story can be implemented

**⚠️ CRITICAL**: No user story work can begin until this phase is complete

- [X] T005 Set up Next.js App Router with basic layout in frontend/src/app/layout.tsx
- [X] T006 [P] Implement Better Auth integration for signup/signin in frontend/src/services/auth/
- [X] T007 Create centralized API client with JWT attachment in frontend/src/services/api-client/
- [X] T008 Implement route protection middleware/guard in frontend/src/services/middleware/
- [X] T009 Set up global styles and Tailwind CSS configuration in frontend/src/styles/
- [X] T010 Create base UI components (Button, Input, Card) in frontend/src/components/ui/
- [X] T011 Configure environment variables handling in frontend/

**Checkpoint**: Foundation ready - user story implementation can now begin in parallel

---

## Phase 3: User Story 1 - User Authentication Flow (Priority: P1) 🎯 MVP

**Goal**: Enable new users to sign up, sign in, and log out of the application so that they can access their personal task list.

**Independent Test**: A user can navigate to the signup page, create an account, log in, and log out successfully.

### Tests for User Story 1 (OPTIONAL - only if tests requested) ⚠️

> **NOTE: Write these tests FIRST, ensure they FAIL before implementation**

- [X] T012 [P] [US1] Contract test for signup endpoint integration in frontend/tests/contract/test_auth.js
- [X] T013 [P] [US1] Contract test for login endpoint integration in frontend/tests/contract/test_auth.js
- [X] T014 [P] [US1] Contract test for logout functionality in frontend/tests/contract/test_auth.js

### Implementation for User Story 1

- [X] T015 [P] [US1] Create signup page component in frontend/src/app/(auth)/signup/page.tsx
- [X] T016 [US1] Create login page component in frontend/src/app/(auth)/login/page.tsx
- [X] T017 [US1] Implement signup form with validation in frontend/src/components/auth/SignupForm.tsx
- [X] T018 [US1] Implement login form with validation in frontend/src/components/auth/LoginForm.tsx
- [X] T019 [US1] Create logout functionality in frontend/src/services/auth/logout.ts
- [X] T020 [US1] Implement session management in frontend/src/services/auth/session.ts
- [X] T021 [US1] Add form validation and error handling in frontend/src/components/auth/validation.ts

**Checkpoint**: At this point, User Story 1 should be fully functional and testable independently

---

## Phase 4: User Story 2 - Task Management (Priority: P1)

**Goal**: Enable authenticated users to create, view, update, complete, and delete their tasks so that they can manage their daily activities effectively.

**Independent Test**: A user can create a task, view it in their list, update its status, and delete it.

### Tests for User Story 2 (OPTIONAL - only if tests requested) ⚠️

- [X] T022 [P] [US2] Contract test for task creation endpoint in frontend/tests/contract/test_tasks.js
- [X] T023 [P] [US2] Contract test for task retrieval endpoint in frontend/tests/contract/test_tasks.js
- [X] T024 [P] [US2] Contract test for task update endpoint in frontend/tests/contract/test_tasks.js
- [X] T025 [P] [US2] Contract test for task deletion endpoint in frontend/tests/contract/test_tasks.js

### Implementation for User Story 2

- [X] T026 [P] [US2] Create tasks page layout in frontend/src/app/tasks/page.tsx
- [X] T027 [US2] Implement task list component in frontend/src/components/tasks/TaskList.tsx
- [X] T028 [US2] Implement task creation form in frontend/src/components/tasks/TaskCreateForm.tsx
- [X] T029 [US2] Implement task editing component in frontend/src/components/tasks/TaskEditForm.tsx
- [X] T030 [US2] Create task completion toggle in frontend/src/components/tasks/TaskCompletionToggle.tsx
- [X] T031 [US2] Implement task deletion functionality in frontend/src/components/tasks/TaskDeleteButton.tsx
- [X] T032 [US2] Add loading, error, and empty state handling in frontend/src/components/tasks/TaskStates.tsx
- [X] T033 [US2] Connect task components to API client in frontend/src/services/api-client/tasks.ts

**Checkpoint**: At this point, User Stories 1 AND 2 should both work independently

---

## Phase 5: User Story 3 - Protected Route Navigation (Priority: P2)

**Goal**: Prevent unauthenticated users from accessing protected routes so that they cannot view other users' data.

**Independent Test**: When an unauthenticated user tries to access the tasks page, they are redirected to the login page.

### Tests for User Story 3 (OPTIONAL - only if tests requested) ⚠️

- [X] T034 [P] [US3] Integration test for route protection in frontend/tests/integration/test_route_guard.js
- [X] T035 [P] [US3] Integration test for redirect behavior in frontend/tests/integration/test_redirects.js

### Implementation for User Story 3

- [X] T036 [P] [US3] Implement protected route component in frontend/src/components/common/ProtectedRoute.tsx
- [X] T037 [US3] Create route guard HOC or hook in frontend/src/hooks/useAuthRedirect.ts
- [X] T038 [US3] Add redirect logic for unauthenticated access in frontend/src/services/middleware/route-guard.ts
- [X] T039 [US3] Implement redirect preservation for post-login navigation in frontend/src/services/auth/navigation.ts
- [X] T040 [US3] Add unauthorized access handling in frontend/src/services/api-client/error-handler.ts

**Checkpoint**: All user stories should now be independently functional

---

[Add more user story phases as needed, following the same pattern]

---

## Phase N: Polish & Cross-Cutting Concerns

**Purpose**: Improvements that affect multiple user stories

- [X] T041 [P] Documentation updates for frontend architecture in docs/frontend-architecture.md
- [X] T042 Code cleanup and refactoring for components
- [X] T043 Performance optimization for API calls and rendering
- [X] T044 [P] Additional unit tests in frontend/tests/unit/
- [X] T045 Accessibility improvements and WCAG compliance
- [X] T046 Responsive design enhancements for mobile
- [X] T047 Run quickstart.md validation for frontend
- [ ] T048 Run frontend folder/NextJs app in localhost

---

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phase 3+)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - User stories can then proceed in parallel (if staffed)
  - Or sequentially in priority order (P1 → P2 → P3)
- **Polish (Final Phase)**: Depends on all desired user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 2 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - May integrate with US1 but should be independently testable
- **User Story 3 (P3)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - May integrate with US1/US2 but should be independently testable

### Within Each User Story

- Tests (if included) MUST be written and FAIL before implementation
- Models before services
- Services before endpoints
- Core implementation before integration
- Story complete before moving to next priority

### Parallel Opportunities

- All Setup tasks marked [P] can run in parallel
- All Foundational tasks marked [P] can run in parallel (within Phase 2)
- Once Foundational phase completes, all user stories can start in parallel (if team capacity allows)
- All tests for a user story marked [P] can run in parallel
- Models within a story marked [P] can run in parallel
- Different user stories can be worked on in parallel by different team members

---

## Parallel Example: User Story 1

```bash
# Launch all tests for User Story 1 together (if tests requested):
Task: "Contract test for signup endpoint integration in frontend/tests/contract/test_auth.js"
Task: "Contract test for login endpoint integration in frontend/tests/contract/test_auth.js"
Task: "Contract test for logout functionality in frontend/tests/contract/test_auth.js"

# Launch all components for User Story 1 together:
Task: "Create signup page component in frontend/src/app/(auth)/signup/page.tsx"
Task: "Create login page component in frontend/src/app/(auth)/login/page.tsx"
Task: "Implement signup form with validation in frontend/src/components/auth/SignupForm.tsx"
```

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 1 Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (CRITICAL - blocks all stories)
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1
4. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test User Story 1 independently
5. Deploy/demo if ready

### Incremental Delivery

1. Complete Setup + Foundational → Foundation ready
2. Add User Story 1 → Test independently → Deploy/Demo (MVP!)
3. Add User Story 2 → Test independently → Deploy/Demo
4. Add User Story 3 → Test independently → Deploy/Demo
5. Each story adds value without breaking previous stories

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple developers:

1. Team completes Setup + Foundational together
2. Once Foundational is done:
   - Developer A: User Story 1
   - Developer B: User Story 2
   - Developer C: User Story 3
3. Stories complete and integrate independently

---

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies
- [Story] label maps task to specific user story for traceability
- Each user story should be independently completable and testable
- Verify tests fail before implementing
- Commit after each task or logical group
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently
- Avoid: vague tasks, same file conflicts, cross-story dependencies that break independence
